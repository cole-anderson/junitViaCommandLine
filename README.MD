#Java Junit tests without build tools

This Repo was inspired by a struggle in a class of mine where we were
expected to do testing that would pass on our school lab computers but our school lab
did not have tools such as VSCode or Maven or Ant or Junit itself etc installed so
this was the creation i came up with in order to run Junit tests without Junit or VSCode
testrunners.

The tests.sh file can run all the commands you need (chmod +x test.sh)
The files only seem to work if they are all in one directory with lib directy accessible
